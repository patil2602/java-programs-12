/*16)	Create a class, Demo with a method, division with two int parameters
a. Dividend b. Divisor
This method should divide the dividend by divisor and return the result.
This method should also throw an Arithmetic Exception to the calling method. Step 2: Create a class, Throws Demo with a main method
The main method should invoke the division method in Demo class
The main method should also catch the Arithmetic Exception thrown by the division method and print the Exception “Arithmetic Exception is Thrown”
The try/catch block should also have a finally block which prints a message “The result is”<Result>
Step 1:In the Demo class division method perform the following logic.
a.	If Divisor is zero throw a Arithmetic Exception with message “Divisor cannot be zero”
b.	This method should throw this Arithmetic Exception.
c.	Step 2: The exception thrown needs to be handled in Throws Demo.
d.	The main method should catch the Arithmetic Exception thrown by the division method and print the Exception and print the message in the exception Object.
e.	The try/catch block should also have a finally block which prints a message “The result is”*/
